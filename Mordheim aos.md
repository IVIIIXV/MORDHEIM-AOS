# AGE OF SIGMAR MORDHEIM CAMPAIGNS

---

# Introduction 

A custom campaign ruleset using the standard rules for Age of Sigmar, Path to glory: Ascension, the Skirmish ruleset & some house rules.

---

# Quick Start

Warband creation

* 200 points of minimum 3 models & 1 hero.  
* Give your leader 5 renown & pick their 1st path.  
* Pick only 1 enhancement, not 1 of each.   
  * Some come in at least 2 parts to work (Battle traits, battle formations, heroic traits).  
  * Take the minimum required for the ability to work.  
* Pick 1 spell, manifestation or prayer the 1st time a spell caster or priest is recruited.

---

# House rules

Glory after a battle

* Fought a battle 20  
* Won Major Victory 20  
* Won Minor Victory 10

Can recruit from the entire alliance.

Can use enhancements from all factions in the alliance. Including formation abilities without the min requirements.

Can transfer enhancements between characters that already have them while respecting limits and only at the end of the campaign round.

Players starting a fight with less points in their combined army are considered as an underdog. Multiple players can be considered as an underdog.

Unlimited recruitment.

Keep track of Unique units renown even if they are not supposed to have paths. If they turn out to be underpowered in late stage campaigns due to the buffs generic units get, consider enabling paths for them. 

Friendly territory in inches from spawn for questing is 7x7 inches per warcry battlefield.

Champions, banners, musicians.

* Always adhere to warscroll limitations.  
* Choose 1 upon recruiting the unit.   
* 2nd at Aspiring.  
* 3rd on Elite.

## Quests

Proving ground

* Gain a Battle trait  
* Choose 1 hero upon accepting the quest to receive it  
* Kill 10 models with that hero.

Forge of war

* Gain a Battle formations  
* Choose 1 hero upon accepting the quest to receive it  
  * Major victory 4  
  * Minor victory 3  
  * Lost the battle 2  
  * Gain 8 points to complete the quest

## Suggestions

In battles that the hero of a quest is not present, nominate another hero that is taking part, they now can gain progress for the quest on that hero\`s behalf.

Starting glory could be higher for more engaging start battles, 4 players 400 glory each?

Or

Players must create 4 regiments with at least 1 hero & 1 other model.

* In a single campaign round, players must split their warband using their regiments into each separate battle instead of using the units.  
* If more than 4 different battles are fought in a single campaign round  
  * write them down in priority order  
  * A new campaign turn starts with all that comes with it.  
  * The order of battles are retained and fought as usual.  
  * The battles may not be fought in sync with the campaign round but it keeps the asymmetric gameplay of picking regiments for battles fair for everyone.  
* Alternatively players can create as much regiments as there are players and play all the battles in a single campaign turn.

Local units give 10 glory to the unit that made the killing blow. 

* Glory gained in battles is carried as loot and can be dropped and looted by others when the unit is destroyed.

Unit Champions can gain enhancements just like heroes when reaching Legendary renown?

# Latest Age of Sigmar Skirmish ruleset

HOW TO USE THESE RULES   
These rules are an extension of the Warhammer Age of Sigmar core rules and the Pitched Battle profiles found in the latest version of the General's Handbook \- so you’ll need a copy of those in order to play Skirmish battles. The only change you need to make is that where a rule refers to an army, it now refers to a warband instead.

WARBANDS   
To fight a Skirmish battle, each player needs to select their warband of fighters. Each warband is a group of warriors drawn from a single Grand Alliance under the leadership of your general, a hero amongst their kind who will see your will done upon the tabletop, or perish in the attempt. The full rules for how these warbands are chosen from the warscrolls available to you are described later.

CHAMPIONS   
Many units in Warhammer Age of Sigmar have leaders \- Liberator-Primes from the Liberator warscroll, Kairic Adepts from Kairic Acolytes, Brute Bosses from Orruk Brutes and so on. These are referred to in these rules as champions and those models gain the Champion keyword.

UPGRADES   
Many units in Warhammer Age of Sigmar have a variety of equipment options available to them. These include weapons, standards, instruments of war, and other, more esoteric choices. The majority of these are choices common to the unit, whereas some are limited in number.

Where an option on a warscroll is limited to a certain number of models in the unit it is referred to here as an upgrade. Upgrades are powerful additions to your warband, but as with all power in the Mortal Realms, there is a price to pay for it, which is covered later.

It is also worth pointing out that some upgrades available on a warscroll may have little to no effect in Skirmish battles, so bear that in mind when making your choices.

CHOOSING YOUR WARBAND   
To select which warriors you will include in your Skirmish warband, follow the rules below, using the renown calculator over the page to determine the total renown of your warband. Then simply find a fellow player with a warband of their own and you are good to go.

First, choose which Grand Alliance your warband will hail from: Chaos, Death, Destruction or Order. All models selected for your warband must hail from the same Grand Alliance as the one you have chosen.

Decide what size of Skirmish battle you wish to play. A good starting size warband for a game that will last a little less than an hour is 250 renown, whereas a Skirmish battle of 500 renown or more will last much longer.

Bear in mind that if you wish to play Skirmish matched play games, there’s a recommended size for your warband see the Skirmish Matched Play section over the page.

Your warband must include a minimum of three models, one of which must be a Hero to be the general of your warband.

You may ignore the minimum unit size requirements on a warscroll \- all count as having a minimum unit size of l model. For example you could select 2 Orruk Brutes rather than the minimum 5 on their warscroll.

You may choose any combination of weapon options for models from the same warscroll, including upgrades (though these will cost more renown when calculating the renown of your warband). For example you may select an Orruk Brute armed with two brute choppas, as well as an Orruk Brute armed with a jagged gore hacka. 

In addition you must adhere to any limitations on weapon options stated on the warscroll. For example, no more than 1 in 5 Orruk Brutes in your warband can be armed with a massive gore- choppa, regardless of the weapon combination of the other models from the same warscroll.

You can only include each warscroll once in your warband.

You may only select each Champion once per warscroll.

Your warband may not incorporate any warscroll battalions, even if your warband would otherwise fulfil the battalion’s organisation requirements.

SKIRMISH FORMATION   
In Skirmish battles, all models in your warband fight as individuals rather than cohesive groups. Each model in your warband is treated as a single unit, and does not have to obey the usual rules for remaining within 1" of other models from their warscroll.

In Skirmish battles, abilities from upgrades that would affect an entire unit (such as a model equipped with a banner, or an instrument) affect friendly models from the same warscroll whilst they are within 6” of any friendly model equipped with the upgrade.

ALLEGIANCE ABILITIES   
Every warrior in the Mortal Realms owes their allegiance to one of the four Grand Alliances: Chaos, Death, Destruction or Order. In Skirmish battles you must select warriors for your warband entirely from a single Grand Alliance, which allows you to use the appropriate allegiance ability listed below. Note these are the only allegiance abilities available for use in Skirmish battles.

CHAOS   
Bloody Offerings: Roll a dice when a friendly Chaos model from your warband is slain within 3” of an enemy model, but before it is removed from play; on a 6 that model can make a pile-in move and then attack with all the melee weapons it is armed with. Then remove that model as normal.

DEATH   
Deathly Vigour: Roll a dice each time you allocate a wound or mortal wound to a friendly Death model; on a 6 that wound or mortal wound is negated.

DESTRUCTION   
Savage Killing Spree: Roll a dice at the end of the combat phase. On a 5+ you can pick one friendly Destruction model that is within 2" of an enemy model; that model can make a pile-in move and then attack with all the melee weapons it is armed with.

ORDER   
Unwavering Will: You can re-roll failed battleshock tests for this warband.

CAN I TAKE NAGASH? Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed that there are no restrictions on taking larger, more powerful models such as Alarielle the Everqueen or a Lord Celestant on Stardrake in Skirmish battles. This is done on purpose \- once you have calculated the renown value of these models you will probably find that many of them are out of reach of the average Skirmish battle (Nagash, Supreme Lord of the Undead, is a mere 800 renown\!) In matched play you’ll find there are rules governing the size of games, but for open and narrative play it’s up to you. This means that you could absolutely play a narrative game where a selection of warbands are sent to attempt the assassination of one of Nagash’s Mortarchs, or even the Great Necromancer himself\! We wish you luck in your efforts though \- your warbands will need it\!

PAGE 2

THE GENERAL   
Every warband is led into battle by a general \- a heroic individual who demands respect and commands authority within their group of warriors.

Each general can be given a command trait and an artefact of power from the following tables. These lists are the only ones available to choose from when selecting an artefact of power or command trait for your general in Skirmish battles.  
   
COMMAND TRAITS   
Each general in Skirmish battles recognises that a different style of leadership is required to maintain order amongst the disparate fighters that make up their warband \- that of leading a group of fighters to victory through personal valour (and in some cases, murderous bloodlust or lethal cunning). Either roll a dice on the following table or pick a command trait that best fits the character of your general.  
   
D6 Command Trait

1 Impetuous Crusader:   
This warrior is ever at the forefront of battle, leading the charge against the enemy.

You can re-roll charge rolls for this general while this general is within 6" of another friendly model.

2 Ambitious Fighter:   
This leader seeks greater glory and will fight all the harder to ensure that none surpass them on the battlefield.

Add 1 to wound rolls for attacks made by this general while it is within 6” of another friendly model.

3 Inspirational:   
When all is lost and courage is flagging around them, true commanders stand fast and become a beacon of hope and determination.

Add 2 to the Bravery characteristic of this general when taking battleshock tests while it is within 6" of another friendly model.

4 Indomitable Will:   
Such is their contempt for sorcery that spells often drain away into nothing before this general's unconquerable soul.

This general can attempt to unbind one spell in the enemy hero phase as if it were a Wizard while it is within 6" of another friendly model.

5 Gifted Commander:   
Specifically chosen to lead this warband, whether through natural affinity or mutual respect, warriors simply perform better under the leadership of this general.

If this general is within 6” of another friendly model at the start of your hero phase, roll a dice. On a 5+, you receive 1 extra command point.

6 Ruthless Conqueror:   
To this leader, failure is unthinkable and they will callously spend the lives of their fighters to achieve their goals. Sacrificial rites, shoving a comrade onto an enemy weapon to distract them \- nothing is beneath this general if it results in victory.

At the start of each combat phase you can choose to sacrifice another model to give this model an advantage. If you do, choose one other friendly model within 3" of both this general and 1 or more enemy models. That friendly model suffers D3 mortal wounds but you can reroll hit rolls of 1 and wound rolls of 1 for attacks made by this general until the end of that combat phase.

ARTEFACTS OF POWER   
Few indeed are the leaders that go to war with weapons or artefacts fashioned by arcane artificers and smiths. Others make do by stealing from the dead, or are deadly enough to do without. Either roll a dice on the following table or pick an artefact that best fits the miniature or temperament of your general.

D6 Artefact of Power 

1 Blessed Amulet:   
Overflowing with power, the bearer of this amulet is magically fortified against harm.

Add 1 to the Wounds characteristic of the bearer.

2 Cursed Tome:   
Only legible to the beam powerful, yet foul and uncomfortable truths about the nature of magic are written within this evil manuscript.

Add 1 to casting rolls made for the bearer. In addition, if the casting roll is a double 1, this model suffers 1 mortal wound after the effects of the spell have been resolved. If this general is not a Wizard, then the bearer can attempt to cast 1 spell in your hero phase as if it were a Wizard instead. They know the Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield spells.

3 Masque of Horror:   
This blank mask twists when others are near, showing them their own face caught in thrall to their greatest fears \- cast aside, palsied and weak or even a slave to the Dark Gods.

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with melee weapons that target the bearer.

4 Armourbane:   
Cast upon an anvil made from broken armour plates, this weapon shatters shields and cleaves breastplates as if they were made from parchment.

Pick one of the bearer’s melee weapons. Improve the Rend characteristic of that weapon by 1\.

5 Oblivion Charm:   
Gifted to the bearer by a devious overlord, this amulet ensures that, should this warrior fall to enemy blades, their death will not have been in vain.

If the bearer is slain, roll a dice for each enemy model within 3” of them before removing them from the battlefield; on a 4+- the model being rolled for suffers 1 mortal wound.

6 Zephyr Shield:   
This amulet causes brief gales of wind to blow around the bearer, knocking missiles aside and fouling the aim of enemies that target them.

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with missile weapons that target the bearer.

PAGE 3

COMMAND ABILITIES AND COMMAND POINTS

Most command abilities are used as normal, according to the core rules. Command points are generated in the normal way.

COMMAND ABILITIES AND BATTLESHOCK

Command abilities that affect battleshock tests cannot be used in Skirmish battles.

BATTLESHOCK   
Do not use the normal rules for the battleshock phase. Instead, in each battleshock phase, a battleshock test must be taken for your whole warband if any models from your warband have been slain during that turn.

To take this battleshock test, roll one dice and add the number of models from your warband that were slain that turn. If the modified roll is greater than your general’s Bravery characteristic, the battleshock test has been failed. For each point by which the total exceeds your general’s Bravery characteristic, one model of your choice from your warband must flee \- remove them from play and count them as having been slain. If your general has been slain, treat your warband as having a Bravery characteristic of 5 for this test.

SUMMONED UNITS   
Any spell, ability or trait that would allow you to add models to a unit, or add a new unit to your warband once the battle has begun, cannot be used in Skirmish battles.

REALM OF BATTLE RULES   
The Realm of Battle rules cannot be used in Skirmish battles.

REALM SPELLS   
Realm Spells (including those in Malign Sorcery) cannot be used in Skirmish battles.

ENDLESS SPELLS   
Warbands cannot include endless spells.

BATTLEPLANS   
On the following pages you’ll find seven Skirmish battleplans. The maps included assume that the battlefield is a 30” by 40” rectangle. If you are using a battlefield that is a different size or shape, you will need to adjust distances, and the location of territories, objectives and terrain features, to fit your battlefield.

SKIRMISH MATCHED PLAY   
Matched play games use the same rules as any other game of Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Skirmish, with the following modifications.

MATCHED PLAY GAME SIZE   
We recommend a limit of 250 renown for Skirmish battles. This is a good-sized warband, and the game will usually be finished in less than an hour.

MATCHED PLAY BATTLEPLANS   
Matched play allows two players to pick warbands of equal power, and there are a selection of battleplans which are designed to provide a tactically challenging game where each side has a more or less equal chance of winning.

Below are three battleplans that are ideal for matched play. Players can either choose which one to play or roll on the following table:

D6 Battleplan 

* 1- 2 Clash at Dawn   
* 2- 4 Treasure Hunt   
* 5 \- 6 Hold the Centre

You can also use any of the battleplans in the ‘Pitched Battles’ section of the General's Handbook, simply by altering the size of the board to a 30 36” by 40 \-48" area and adjusting the distance between objectives appropriately. All of these battleplans have been designed to present both players with matching objectives and territories as well as a variety of tactical decisions.

TOURNAMENTS   
For tournament play we recommend warbands with a value of 250 renown. From there there are many options open to a tournament organiser. You could increase the renown value of the warbands after each game by a set amount, or allow players to improve their warbands using the ‘Between Games’ section in the Campaign section which will come in a later issue of White Dwarf (stay tuned\!).

In an eight hour period it should be possible to play five or even six Skirmish battles, allowing for a relaxed pace and time for some lunch, as well as the option to play a variety of battleplans to keep things fresh and exciting.

To determine a winner, you could choose to pick the player who earned the most renown over the day, or assign a value to a player’s result from each battleplan as shown below.

Major Victory 30   
Minor Victory 20   
Draw 10   
Loss 0

To further divide up your players and prevent tied placements, you could also track the renown value of models slain by a player’s warband and use that total to determine which players stand triumphant at the end of the day.

HOUSE RULES   
There is almost no limit to the ways you might choose to customize your Skirmish battles. 

You could require that all starting warbands include at least one Wizard, or place restrictions on certain types of models so only those with the Leader battlefield role and so on. Each of these tweaks can provide an interesting tactical challenge to players and add greater variety to games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Skirmish.

WARHAMMER AGE OF SIGMAR SKIRMISH RENOWN CALCULATOR

What follows is a simple calculator to allow you to convert your favourite models from Warhammer Age of Sigmar into individuals you can select for Skirmish battles. To begin with there is a step by step guide, and after that are modifications for certain, more powerful models you can take, such as a Liberator-Prime or an Orruk Brute armed with a massive Gore-choppa.

Step 1: Pick a unit from which you wish to take a model for your warband.

Step 2: Look up the cost in points of the unit from the most recent version of the General's Handbook.  
   
CHAMPIONS AND UPGRADES   
The model you selected can have any weapon option that is available to all models in the unit at no additional cost.

If you wish for the model you selected to have an optional upgrade that is available in limited numbers on its unit’s warscroll, add 5 to the cost of the model. Remember that you must abide by any limitations on such upgrades as described earlier.

If you wish your model to be a Champion from that unit, add 5 to the cost of the model. Remember each Champion can only be selected once per warscroll.

Step 3: Take the points cost and divide it by the minimum size of the unit to give the cost for a single model.

Step 4: If there is a remainder, simply round down the number.In other words, remove any fractions that remain after step 3\. So 10.2 would become 10, for example. This is the model’s renown.

Unit Targeting   
Abilities/Spells/Effects that would affect an entire friendly/enemy unit, affect friendly/enemy models whilst they are within 6” of the model being targeted with the Ability/Spell/Effect. A model needs to be selected to be the target of the Ability/Spell/Effect in the same manner a unit would be selected in the Age of Sigmar ruleset.
